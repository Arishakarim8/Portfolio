            I am a skilled frontend developer who is now diving into Next.js to master both backend and frontend development. My journey in tech took a transformative turn when I completed a TypeScript course under the Governor Sindh IT Initiative (GIAIC). This experience paved the way for me to explore Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineering and work with cutting-edge technologies. As a senior student at GIAIC, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and take great pride in mentoring my peers to help them excel in their learning journeys.
